        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The world pizza is believed to be from an Old Italian word meaning “a point,” which in turn became the Italian word “pizzicare,” which means “to pinch” or “pluck.” In one of its many forms, pizza has been a basic part of the Italian diet since the Stone Age.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>yeast</li> 
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>mozzarella</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal). </li>
            <li>Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
